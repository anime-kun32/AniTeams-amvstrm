# Projetc details 
AniTeams , but this time it uses Amvstrm api , and a new layout as well .

# Domains
https://aniteams-amvstrm.vercel.app
https://ani-teams-different-server.vercel.app
# Usage 
Fork the reposoitory . Before deploying update the script api with your onw deployed version of the amvstrm , if you don't do this it will not work . The reason is because i don't several traffic on the one i'm using 
so i set an allow list on the env file , meaning that it only works on the domains
